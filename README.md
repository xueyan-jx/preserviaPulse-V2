# preserviaPulse
*Pulsing forward with actionable steps to preserve biodiversity.*

## Introduction

**preserviaPulse** is a project focused on understanding the distribution of species with special conservation status, and their future changes in the [Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/stories-in-california/dangermond-preserve/). By integrating species distribution modeling with climate projections and connectivity analysis, this project identifies critical regions for conservation and provides actionable recommendations to guide adaptive land management under climate change.

Our goal is to support science-informed decision-making that helps preserve biodiversity and ecological resilience in one of California’s most unique and biologically rich landscapes.
